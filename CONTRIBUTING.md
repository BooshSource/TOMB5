## Contributing

Pull requests which drastically alter the structure/architecture of the code will not be accepted. This is to maintain "santiy" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.

If you're able to code in C/C++ please feel free to contact me. I can assign you tasks to prevent collisions with my local code which is not pushed yet. I'm typically looking for pull requests which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability or introduce new decompiled methods.

## Current Positions

- MIPS R3000 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 PSX MIPS Disassembled output back to C.
- x86 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 PC x86 asm back to C. 
- SH4 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 Dreamcast SH4 asm back to C. 
- Platform Programmer (Mac) - (Maintain and ensure that PSXPC code compiles under Mac OSX).
- Platform Programmer (Linux) - (Maintain and ensure that PSXPC code compiles under Linux).
- Code Analyser (ASM - PSX) - Compare compiled code to the original to help detect any possible errors in exising code.
- Debugger - Debug existing code issues/crashes, propose a solution by basing the patch off the original disassembly.
- General Programmer - Clean existing code to improve readability without changing the structure, improve code documentation.
- Build Engineer - Manage and maintain existing Travis/Appveyor build automation systems. Improve code distribution/publishing methods by implmenting a system to support all platforms and possible release versions.
