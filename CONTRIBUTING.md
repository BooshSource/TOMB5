## Contributing

Pull requests which drastically alter the structure/architecture of the code will not be accepted. This is to maintain "santiy" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.

If you're able to code in C/C++ please feel free to contact me. I can assign you tasks to prevent collisions with my local code which is not pushed yet. I'm typically looking for pull requests which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability or introduce new decompiled methods.

## Current Positions

- MIPS R3000 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 PSX MIPS Disassembled output back to C.
- x86 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 PC x86 asm back to C. 
- SH4 Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 Dreamcast SH4 asm back to C. 
- Platform Programmer (Mac) - (Maintain and ensure that the code compiles under Mac OSX).
- Platform Programmer (Linux) - (Maintain and ensure that the code compiles under Linux).
- General Debugger - Debug existing gameplay code, compare to the original game to ensure code is functioning correctly.
- General Programmer - Clean existing code to improve readability without changing the structure, improve code documentation.
