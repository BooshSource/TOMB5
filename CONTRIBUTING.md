## Contributing

I will not accept pull requests which drastically alter the structure/architecture of the code. This is to maintain "santiy" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.

If you're able to code in C/C++ please feel free to contact me. I can assign you tasks to prevent collisions with my local code which is not pushed yet. I'm typically looking for pull requests which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability or introduce new decompiled methods.
