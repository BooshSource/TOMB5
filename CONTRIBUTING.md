## Contributing

I will not accept pull requests which drastically alter the structure/architecture of the code. This is to maintain "santiy" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.

If you're able to code in C/C++ please feel free to contact me. I can assign you tasks to prevent collisions with my local code which is not pushed yet. I'm typically looking for pull requests which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability or introduce new decompiled methods.

## Current Positions

1. MIPS Programmer/Interpreter - Translate TR5 MIPS Disassembled output back to C. 
2. Platform Programmer (Mac) - (Maintain and ensure that the code compiles under Mac OSX).
3. Platform Programmer (Linux) - (Maintain and ensure that the code compiles under Linux).
4. General Debugger - Debug existing gameplay code, compare to the original game to ensure code is functioning correctly.
5. General Programmer - Clean existing code to improve readability without changing the structure, improve code documentation.
